# Xdebug Trace Viewer

This project aims at creating GUI tools for viewing Xdebug call trace files(.xt), duh.

Right now it has a WPF GUI app and a console dumper app, 
but I have plans to make Gtk# GUI app to be used with Mono.

The current version is very limited in functionality, 
I will try to add new features continually. 

Feel free to submit ideas and bugs to the [issues](https://github.com/boykathemad/xdebug-trace-viewer/issues) of this repository.
Any code improvements are welcome, so please do fork and submit pull requests.
